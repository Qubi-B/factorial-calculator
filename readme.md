# Factorial calculator
Hi. This is a repo I have created to learn Git and Github.
For having something to do in the meantime, I have decided to create an app for calculating factorials in HTML and JS.

You may, or **may not** find this useful.

## Access
You can clone the repo and use the html file locally on your machine _or_ access it via GitHub Pages at:
> https://qubi-b.github.io/factorial-calculator/
